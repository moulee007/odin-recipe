    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>

        <li>2 pounds (about 1 kg) of chicken pieces (mix of drumsticks, thighs, and wings)</li>
        <li>2 cups (480 ml) buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust according to spice preference)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
      </ul>
      
       
    <h3> <em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>
          <p>In a large bowl, pour the buttermilk over the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully submerged.<br>
          Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight.
             This helps tenderize the chicken and infuses it with flavor.</p>
          </p>
            </li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the Breading Mixture:</strong>
          <p>In a shallow dish, mix the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Adjust the seasoning to your liking.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Coat the Chicken:</strong>
          <p>Take each piece of chicken out of the buttermilk, allowing any excess to drip off.</p>
          <p>Roll the chicken pieces in the seasoned flour mixture, ensuring they are fully coated. You can press the flour onto the chicken to make sure it sticks well.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Rest the Coated Chicken:</strong>
          <p>Place the coated chicken on a wire rack to allow excess flour to fall off and let the coating adhere to the chicken for a few minutes. This helps the breading stick better during frying.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Heat the Oil:</strong>
          <p>In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat about 2 inches (5 cm) of vegetable oil to 350째F (175째C). Use a kitchen thermometer to monitor the temperature.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Fry the Chicken:</strong>
          <p>Carefully place a few pieces of chicken into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry each piece for about 12-15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C), and the coating is golden brown and crispy.</p>
          <p>Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the fried chicken and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Serve:</strong>
          <p>Allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes before serving. Serve your crispy fried chicken with your favorite dipping sauces, coleslaw, or potato wedges.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Enjoy your homemade crispy fried chicken!</p>
